      Intel Products; and

      (2) “Licensed Patent Claims” means those claims of Intel’s patents that
      are infringed by the Software itself, in its unmodified form, as furnished
      by Intel to You and not combined with anything else.

    (C) Unless specifically set forth in this Section 2.1, Intel grants You no
    other license or right to any Intel patents, copyrights, mask works, trade
    secrets, or other intellectual property, expressly or by implication,
    estoppel, statute or otherwise.  Intel reserves all rights that it does not
    expressly grant to You in this Agreement.

  2.2	Restrictions.

    (A) All rights, title and interest in and to the Software and Documentation
    are and will remain the exclusive property of Intel.  Unless expressly
    permitted under Section 2.1(A), You will not, and will not allow any third
    party to:

      (1)	use, copy or distribute the Software or Documentation;

      (2) modify, adapt, enhance, disassemble, decompile, reverse engineer,
      change or create Derivative Works from the Software; or

      (3) use the Software to process the data of, or make the Software
      available online for the use of, third parties.

    (B) No right or license is granted or implied under any of Intel’s

    intellectual property rights to use the Software or Documentation or to
    license or authorize others to use the Software or Documentation beyond the
    rights expressly set forth in this Agreement.

    (C) Except as expressly permitted under Section 2.1, You will not allow the
    Software to be accessed or used by third parties.  Notwithstanding the
    foregoing, Your authorized consultants and subcontractors may access the
    Software where the access is incidental to their performing services on Your
    behalf consistent with the license granted to You under this Agreement,
    provided You bind those consultants and subcontractors to the
    confidentiality and other obligations imposed on You under this Agreement
    and You are fully liable to Intel for the actions and inaction of those
    consultants and subcontractors.

  2.3 Copies.  In addition to the number of copies permissible under Section
  2.1(A)(1), You may make a reasonable number of copies of the Software for
  archival purposes or for use as a back-up when the Software is not
  operational.  You must copy all copyright legends, trademarks, trade names and
  other legends and identification when You copy the Software and Documentation.
  You will maintain records of the number of copies currently in Your possession
  or control, and will provide copies of those records to Intel upon request.

  2.4 Open Source Software.  If the Software includes Open Source Software, that
  Open Source Software is licensed under the applicable Open Source Software
  license agreement identified in the Open Source Software comments in the
  applicable source code file(s) and file header provided with the Software.
  Where applicable, the Documentation may contain additional detail.  With
  respect to the Open Source Software, nothing in this Agreement limits any

  Open Source Software license agreement.  You will not subject the Software or
  Documentation, in whole or in part, to any license obligations associated with
  Open Source Software, including combining the Software or Documentation with
  Open Source Software in a manner that subjects Intel, or any portion of the
  Software, to any license obligations of the Open Source Software.

  requirements for Intel to include in the Software definition, design or
  validation.

6.	SUPPORT

  6.1 Services.  Intel has no obligation to maintain or support the Software or
  Documentation under this Agreement.  Please contact Intel to determine if
  maintenance or support is available under a separate agreement.

  You are directed to access Intel’s webpage, http://software.intel.com/en-us/,
  for basic FAQs and other Intel product resources relating to the Software.
  Under no circumstances will Intel have any obligation to Your Customers with
  respect to maintenance or support of the Software.

  6.2 Additional Services.  Intel has no obligation to perform any maintenance

  on terms to be agreed by the Parties.

7.	NO PUBLICITY

  7.1 No Publicity.  You may not use Intel’s name, or the names of any Intel

  Intel’s prior written consent in each instance.

8.	INDEMNITY

  8.1	By You. 

    (A) You will defend, at Your own expense, any legal action brought against
    Intel to the extent that it is based on an Indemnified Claim, which is any
    claims or allegations arising from or relating to Your breach of any
    provision of this Agreement including, but not limited to, a breach of
    Section 2;

    (B) You will pay any costs and damages finally awarded against Intel that
    are attributable to any Indemnified Claim or that Intel incurs through
    settlement of an Indemnified Claim, but will not be responsible for any
    compromise that Intel makes or expense that Intel incurs without Your
    consent.  The defense and payments are subject to the condition that Intel
    gives You prompt written notice of the Indemnified Claim, allows You to
    direct the defense and settlement of the Indemnified Claim, and cooperates
    with You as necessary for defense and settlement of the Indemnified Claim.

9.	WARRANTY

  Disclaimer.  Intel makes no warranties to You with respect to the Software or
  any Support, service, advice, or assistance furnished under this Agreement,
  and no warranties of any kind, whether written, oral, implied or statutory,
  including warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose,
  non-infringement or arising from course of dealing or usage in trade will
  apply.

10.	LIMITATION OF LIABILITY	

  (A) Intel’s cumulative liability to You for all claims of any kind resulting
  from Intel’s performance or breach of this Agreement or the Software furnished
  under this Agreement will not exceed the Fees actually received by Intel from
  You under this Agreement for the Software that is the subject of the claim or
  $1,000, if the Software was provided at no charge to You, regardless of
  whether Intel has been advised of the possibility of those damages or whether
  any remedy set forth in this Agreement fails of its essential purpose or
  otherwise.  This limitation of liability is cumulative and not per incident;
  the existence of more than one claim will not increase the limit.

  (B) Intel will not be liable for costs of procurement of substitutes, loss of
  profits, loss of use, interruption of business, or for any other special,
  consequential, punitive or incidental damages, however caused, whether for
  breach of warranty, contract, tort, negligence, strict liability or otherwise,
  irrespective of whether Intel has advance notice of the possibility of such
  damages.  The limitation of liability set forth in this Section 10 is a
  fundamental basis of this Agreement; and each Party understands and agrees
  that the other would not have entered into this Agreement without the
  limitation of liability.

11.	GENERAL PROVISIONS

  11.1	Notices.

  11.2 Audit Rights.  Upon reasonable advance notice, Intel will have the right
  to inspect, or have an independent auditor inspect, Your facilities and

  right to recover the cost of the audit.

  11.3 Export.  The Software, Documentation and all related technical
  information or materials are subject to export controls and (are or may be)
  licensable under U.S. Government export regulations.  You will not export,
  re-export, divert, transfer or disclose, directly or indirectly, the Software,
  Documentation and any related technical information or materials without
  complying strictly with all legal requirements including, without limitation,
  obtaining the prior approval of the U.S. Department of Commerce and, if
  necessary, other agencies or departments of the U.S. Government.  Please
  access Intel’s website,
  http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/legal/export-compliance.html, for
  information regarding the export classification of the Software that may be
  necessary to assist Your compliance with this provision.  You will execute and
  deliver to Intel “Letters of Assurance” as may be required under applicable
  export regulations.  You will indemnify Intel against any loss related to Your
  failure to conform to these requirements.

  11.4	No Sublicensing, Assignment or Transfer.

    (A) You may not delegate, assign or transfer this Agreement, or any of Your
    rights and obligations under this Agreement, and any attempt to do so will
    be void.  In addition, You may not sublicense, assign or transfer any
    Software, Documentation, Confidential Information or any part of the
    Software, Documentation or Confidential Information, or any right in this
    Agreement to any third party temporarily (such as loaning, rental, licensing
    or timeshare) or permanently, except as expressly permitted under Section
    2.1 or 2.2, without the prior written consent of Intel in each instance,
    which consent Intel may withhold in its sole discretion.  Any attempted
    sublicense, assignment or transfer that is not expressly permitted under
    Section 2 or is without consent will be void.

    (B) You agree that this Agreement binds You and each of Your affiliates and
    the employees, agents, representatives and persons associated with any of
    them.  Without limitation of the foregoing, if there is a sale of
    substantially all of Your assets, a merger, a re-organization, or a change
    in control of 50% or more of Your equity, no transfer or assignment
    (including, without limitation, an assignment by operation of law) of this
    Agreement may be made without the prior written consent of Intel.

  11.5 U.S. Government Contract Provisions.  This Agreement is for Your
  temporary license of Software.  No Government procurement regulation or
  contract clauses or provision will be considered a part of any transaction
  between the Parties under this Agreement unless its inclusion is required by
  statute, or mutually agreed upon in writing by the Parties in connection with
  a specific transaction.  The technical data and computer software covered by
  this license is a “Commercial Item,” as that term is defined by the FAR 2.101
  (48 C.F.R. 2.101) and is “commercial computer software” and “commercial
  computer software documentation” as specified under FAR 12.212 (48
  C.F.R. 12.212) or DFARS 227.7202 (48 C.F.R. 227.7202), as applicable.  This
  commercial computer software and related documentation is provided to end
  users for use by and on behalf of the U.S. Government, with only those rights
  as are granted to all other end users under the terms and conditions in this
  Agreement.  Use for or on behalf of the U.S. Government is permitted only if
  the party acquiring or using this Software is properly authorized by an
  appropriate U.S. Government official.  This use by or for the U.S. Government
  clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFARS, or other provision
  that addresses Government rights in the computer Software or documentation
  covered by this license.  All copyright licenses granted to the
  U.S. Government are coextensive with the technical data and computer Software
  licenses granted in this Agreement.  The U.S. Government will only have the
  right to reproduce, distribute, perform, display, and prepare Derivative Works
  as needed to implement those rights.

  11.6 Force Majeure.  Except for Your obligations under Section 3, neither
  Party will be liable to the other Party for delay in performing its
  obligations, or failure to perform any obligations, under this Agreement, if
  the delay or failure results from circumstances beyond the control of that
  Party including, but not limited to, any acts of God, governmental act, fire,
  explosion, accident, war, armed conflict, terrorist act or civil commotion.
  If there is a delay, the time for performance will be extended by the amount
  of time lost by reason of the delay; provided, however, should an event of
  force majeure described in this Section delay either Party’s performance in
  any material respect for a period of more than 90 days, then the other Party
  will have the option, upon giving written notice, to terminate this Agreement
  or the relevant portion of this Agreement affected by the delay.

  11.7 Waiver and Severability.  If either Party fails to enforce at any time
  any of the provisions of this Agreement, or to exercise any election of
  options provided in this Agreement, that failure will not constitute a waiver
  of that provision or option, or affect the validity of this Agreement or any
  part of this Agreement, or the right of the waiving Party to enforce
  subsequently each and every provision.  If any provision of this Agreement is
  held invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of the Agreement will continue in
  full force and effect.

  11.8	Governing Law; Jurisdiction.  

    (A) The procedural and substantive laws of the State of Delaware, U.S.A.,
    without regard to its conflicts of laws principles, will govern this
    Agreement.  This Agreement is prepared and executed and will be interpreted
    in the English language only, and no translation of the Agreement into
    another language will have any effect.  The Parties agree that the United
    Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (1980)
    is specifically excluded from and will not apply to this Agreement.

    (B) The state and federal courts located in the State of Delaware will have
    exclusive jurisdiction of all disputes and litigation arising out of or
    related to this Agreement including, without limitation, matters connected
    with its performance.  Each Party irrevocably submits to the personal
    jurisdiction of those courts and irrevocably waives all objections to such
    venue.

  11.9 Entire Agreement.  This Agreement, the Attachments, Exhibits, Appendix
  and Non Disclosure Agreement(s) contain the complete and exclusive statement
  of the agreement between the Parties and supersede all proposals, oral or
  written, and all other communications between the Parties relating to the
  subject matter of this Agreement.  Only a written instrument duly executed by
  authorized representatives of Intel and You may modify this Agreement.
